Consider the gray-scale image<strong>, Car on Mountain Road.tif </strong>below, (a) apply the <strong>Marr-Hildreth </strong>edge detection algorithm to obtain the edge image. Plot all the images generated during the entire step-by-step procedure of applying the algorithm. Assume two thresholds: 0% and 4% the maximum gray level of the LoG image (refer to Example 10.7 and Figure 10.22). (b) <strong>Edge linking by Hough transform</strong>: based on the edge map obtained in (a) using 4% max{Log} as the threshold, use the Hough transform to perform <em>edge linking</em>. Firstly, determine the Hough parameter space using 1 increments for and 1-pixel increments for . Make the same plot as Figure 10.31(c) (Example 10.12). From your results of Hough parameter space, determine <em>the possible cells for the license plate </em>to make the same plots as Figures 10.31(d) and (e).

Your report (Word or pdf format) should contain:

<ul>

 <li>Source codes (30%)</li>

 <li>Figures of the LoG image (10%), binary images by zero-crossings with threshold of 0 and 4% of max(LoG) (30%)</li>

 <li>Figure of <em>Hough parameter space</em>, refer to Fig 10.31(c) (15%)</li>

 <li>Figures of linked edges alone and overlapped on the original image, refer to Fig 10.31(d),(e) (15%)</li>

</ul>

<strong>Note: Images must be plotted with good resolution</strong>
